    "# What is ROOT?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROOT is a software framework that can be used for:\n",
    "  - Data processing\n",
    "  - Data analysis\n",
    "  - Data visualisation\n",
    "  - Data storage\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- ROOT is written mainly in **C++**, with powerful **Python** bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopted in High Energy Physics and other sciences (but also industry)\n",
    "  - **1 EB** of data in ROOT format\n",
    "  - Fits and parameters’ estimations for discoveries (e.g. the Higgs)\n",
    "  - Thousands of ROOT plots in scientific publications\n",
    "## ROOT's building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "ROOT can be seen as a collection of building blocks for various activities, such as:\n",
    "- **Data analysis: histograms, graphs, functions**\n",
    "- **High-level analysis interfaces**: RDataFrame\n",
    "- **Statistical tools** (RooFit/RooStats): rich modeling and statistical inference\n",
    "- **I/O**: storage of any C++ object, **column-wise** storage of datasets\n",
    "- **Math**: non-trivial functions (e.g. Erf, Bessel), optimised math functions\n",
    "- **C++ interpretation**: full language compliance\n",
    "- **Multivariate analysis** (TMVA): e.g. Boosted decision trees, Neural Nets\n",
    "- **Advanced graphics** (2D, 3D, event display)\n",
    "- And more: HTTP servering,  JavaScript visualisation\n",

    "# Today's goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- be able to conduct simple data analysis using ROOT\n",
    "- get familiar with basic ROOT features: histograms, graphs, functions\n",
    "- get to know what ROOT file format is\n",
    "- don't be afraid of reaching out, asking questions and contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful links\n",
