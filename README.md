This is a self-contained tutorial for STAR/EIC workshop aimed at learning some ROOT basics




---

## I like to run it on my own system:

- Git clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aprozo/root_workshop
```

- One needs to install [ROOT](https://root.cern/install/)

- Then install some additional packages with

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install -y git python3-pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade wheel jupyter metakernel dask distributed pyspark
```

- After it run

```bash
root --notebook
```

Part of the material has been reused from:

- https://github.com/root-project/training
- https://github.com/root-project/software-carpentry



If facing a problem with ROOT kernel [ROOT C++ kernel](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/jupyroot), one has to run it in terminal

```bash
mkdir -p  ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
cp -r $ROOTSYS/etc/notebook/kernels/root ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels
jupyter notebook --allow-root
```

Then, wait untill the page is reloaded and choose Jupyter Kernel -> ROOT
